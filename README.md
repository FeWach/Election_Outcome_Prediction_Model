Election Outcome Prediction App

## Project Description

The purpose of this project is to design and implement a unsupervised ML model, which will be able to predict the outcome of a democratically held election with high accuracy. The possible scenarios related to the election outcome are twofold: either the current government, consisting of the incumbent party, or a coalition of parties, will be confirmed by the voters and stay in power OR there will be a regime change. The goal is NOT to predict if a certain candidate or party will win or lose but rather to give insight into whether a change in government is likely or not. To train the model, data has been collected based on categories which were deemed potentially relevant to the outcome of a federal election. These included major economic indicators, like GDP growth or inflation rate, as well as political and societal factors such as whether the incumbent president is in his or her final constitutional term or whether a war with global impact is currently being fought. The goal in regards to data selection was to come up with as few categories as possible which could be indicative of either change or continuity. Given the comparatively long history as a democratically governed nation as well as the availability of data, the current version of the app features only one country, the United States of America with its two-party system but could theoretically be applied to any other country with free and fair elections.
## Use Case

This app and its underlying model can be used to study which factors may influence voter behavior and lead to different election outcomes on a macropolitical (federal) level. 


## Comments

Extraordinary events (EE) are defined as high-impact events with the potential to influence national election outcomes. The following count as EE: major political scandal involving the incumbent (party) and/or the opponent (i.e. corruption, impeachment (procedures) or assassination (attempts)) financial crises, terror attacks with significant casualties, social upheaval and/or coup d'etat / attempts to overthrow the government.

Wars in the context of this project are defined as either far-reaching military confrontations between two or more states, excluding regional wars with no signficant global impact, or civil-wars within the country studied.
