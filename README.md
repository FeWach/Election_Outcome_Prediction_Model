## Project Title

Political Election Simulator

## Project Description

The purpose of this project is to design and implement a unsupervised ML model, which will be able to simulate a democratic election and predict its outcome with high accuracy. In case of the presidential election of the United States of America, two possible election outcomes exist: either the sitting president, or another representative of his/her party will stay in power OR voters decide in favor of regime change. It is important to note, that the model is designed to make a prediction based on information which can indicate whether a change in government is more likely than not and is agnostic to any qualitative or quantitative information which it hasn't been trained on, like news stories or policy preferences. The choice of the data used for the model was determined by identifying those factors, which were considered to be of significant relevance to the outcome of a federal election. These included major economic indicators, like annual GDP growth or the inflation rate, as well as political and societal macro-factors, such as whether the incumbent president is in his or her final term, or whether the world is dealing with any wars with supraregional impact. The goal was to use as few categories as possible, and only those, which could reliably indicate a desire for either change or continuity of the voter base. Given its comparatively long history as a democracy as well as the availability of historical data, the current version of the app features only one country, the United States of America, but could theoretically be applied to any other country with free and fair elections and enough available data.
## Use Case

The model can be used to study, which factors may ultimately impact voting behavior and lead to different election outcomes on the federal level. 


## Comments

Extraordinary events (EE) are defined as high-impact events with the potential to influence national election outcomes. The following count as EE: major political scandal involving the incumbent (party) and/or the opponent (i.e. corruption, impeachment (procedures) or assassination (attempts)) financial crises, terror attacks with significant casualties, social upheaval and/or coup d'etat / attempts to overthrow the government.

Wars in the context of this project are defined as either far-reaching military confrontations between two or more states, excluding regional wars with no signficant global impact, or civil-wars within the country at hand.
